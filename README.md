# 2D Tissue Reassembly with E(2)-Equivariant Graph Neural Cellular Automata

A PyTorch implementation of a cellular automata model that learns to reassemble 2D tissue patterns while respecting E(2) symmetries (translations, rotations, and reflections). The model combines Graph Neural Networks with Neural Cellular Automata to create a system that can reconstruct tissue patterns from scattered cells.

## Features
- E(2)-equivariant neural network architecture
- Graph-based cellular interactions
- Continuous space cellular automata
- Support for various tissue patterns and cell configurations

## Installation

Create a new conda environment and install the dependencies.


Then install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
